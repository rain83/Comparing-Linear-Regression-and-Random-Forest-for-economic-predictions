# [Predictive Modeling in Finance: Linear Regression vs. Random Forest]

## Overview
This project explores and compares **Linear Regression (LR)** and **Random Forest (RF)** models for predictive analytics in financial and economic data. 
The goal is to evaluate how traditional statistical methods perform against machine learning approaches in forecasting and pattern recognition.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares financial/economic data.
- **Model Training:** Implements LR and RF models for predictions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compares accuracy, RMSE, and feature importance.
- **Visualization:** Plots predictions, residuals, and feature contributions.
- **Insights:** Discusses model strengths and weaknesses in financial applications.

## Modules used:
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, Random Forest
- **Data Sources:** Yahoo Finance

## Key comparisons:
| Feature                | Linear Regression | Random Forest |
|----------------------- |------------------|----------------|
| Interpretability       | High             | Moderate       |
| Handling Non-Linearity | Poor             | Strong         |
| Overfitting Risk       | Low              | Moderate-High  |
| Feature Importance     | Explicit         | Derived        |
| Computational Cost     | Low              | Higher         |

## Future enhancements:
- Incorporating additional ML models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Using cross-validation for better generalization
- Expanding the dataset to include macroeconomic indicators or a categorical time series sentiment score.
